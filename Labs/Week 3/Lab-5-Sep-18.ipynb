    "### What have we covered so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sep 6: \n",
    "- Python basics \n",
    "    - Data types: Integer (`int`), Float (`float`), String (`str`), Boolean (`bool`), Complex (`complex`)\n",
    "    - Operations: Basic math ops, Boolean (comparisons, `and`, `or`), String (concatenation, multiplication)\n",
    "    - Libraries (scipy.constants)\n",
    "- Jupyter notebooks \n",
    "    - Lifecycle: creating, editing, running, saving, closing (in syzygy server)\n",
    "    - Markdown vs Code cells\n",
    "    - Raw data format *(not covered)*\n",
    "- Git *(not covered)*\n",
    "    - Simplest Lifecycle:\n",
    "        1. Create a repo on github's website\n",
    "        2. Copy the repo's url\n",
    "        3. Clone the repo to your computer using git clone <url>\n",
    "        4. Make changes to the repo\n",
    "        5. Add the changes to the staging area using git add <filename>\n",
    "        6. Commit the changes using git commit -m \"message\"\n",
    "        7. Push the changes to the remote repo using git push\n",
    "    - Setup an SSH key and clone using SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sep 7:\n",
    "- Basic calculation of free falling object example\n",
    "- Number bases: Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal\n",
    "- Binary\n",
    "- Fixed point number\n",
    "- Floating point number \n",
    "    - Single precision\n",
    "    - Double precision\n",
    "- Rounding Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time with this material. It's not something that makes sense right away. It's something that you have to think about and work with for a while before it starts to make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**THIS JUST IN!!! PYTHON LIES TO YOU! (sometimes)**\n",
    "[taken right from python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "''\n",
    "On most machines, if Python were to print the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1, it would have to display\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 0.1\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\n",
    "```\n",
    "That is more digits than most people find useful, so Python keeps the number of digits manageable by displaying a rounded value instead\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1 / 10\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "0.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Just remember, even though the printed result looks like the exact value of 1/10, the actual stored value is the nearest representable binary fraction.\n",
    "''\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why it's not always important to worry about your result be 0 or 1e-9. It's more important to know that it's close to 0.\n",

    "## Sep 11:\n",
    "- Case study: Final size of an epidemic\n",
    "- Importing libraries and functions from libraries\n",
    "- Reading docstrings using `help()`\n",
    "- Root finding with tangent lines\n",
    "- `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Worthwhile revisiting the modelling for final size of epidemic. In this class I think there are two main takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learning how to program in Python and high level languages in general.\n",
    "2. Learning how to create mathematical models and solve them with computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your interests, you may find that focusing your extra studies on one more than the other will be more beneficial to you. For example, if you're interested in programming, spend some more time working on learning the number systems from Sep 7th. If you're leaning towards math, spend some more time studying final size of epidemic from Sep 11th.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Convergence of Newton's method\n",
    "- `for` loop\n",

    "- Python functions (defining, calling, arguments, default arguments, return values)\n",
    "- Looking at root_scalar function from scipy.optimize for root finding\n",
