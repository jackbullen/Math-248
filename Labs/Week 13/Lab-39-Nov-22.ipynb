    "b_eq: Constant terms on the right-hand side of the equality constraints.\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "from scipy.optimize import linprog\n",
    "\n",
    "c = [coefficients for objective function]\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Only Inequality Constraints (A_ub, b_ub)\n",
    "When the problem only has inequality constraints, you'll use A_ub and b_ub.\n",

    "#### Both Equality and Inequality Constraints\n",
