2,"The number of births is final up to 2020/2021, updated for 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
3,"Starting in January 2022, estimates of births are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601). Before January 2022, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3231). However, before January 2010, the final estimates included in this table may differ from vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory). Due to incomplete births data in 2021 and 2022, births data from vital statistics were estimated for Nova Scotia for August to December 2021 and for Manitoba for the whole 2021 and 2022 years."
4,"The number of deaths is final up to 2020/2021, updated for 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
5,"Starting in January 2021, estimates of deaths are produced by the Centre for Demography, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3601), incorporating provisional deaths data from the Centre for Population Health Data. Before January 2021, data are from Vital Statistics – Birth and Death Databases, Statistics Canada (See Definitions, data sources and methods record number 3233). However, before January 2013, the estimates included in this table may differ from vital statistics already released by Statistics Canada, due to the imputation of certain unknown values (province or territory)."
6,"The number of immigrants is final up to 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
7,"Net emigration is obtained as follows: Emigrants - Returning emigrants. For estimates from 1991 to June 2016, net emigration is obtained as follows: Emigrants + Net temporary emigration - Returning emigrants."
8,"The estimated numbers of emigrants and returning emigrants have been revised going back to July 2016. Before this date, short-term emigrants and short-term returning emigrants were included in the “net temporary emigration” component. After this date, they are included in the emigrant and returning emigrant components, using a slightly different methodology. Due to this change, the net temporary emigration component is no longer calculated from July 2016 onwards."
9,"The number of emigrants is final up to 2020/2021, updated for 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
10,"Please note that due to the methodology used for the estimates of the emigration and the returning emigration, the estimates for the most recent periods are expected to be identical or very similar."
11,"The number of returning emigrants is final up to 2020/2021, updated for 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
12,"The net temporary emigrants is final up to 2015/2016."
13,"A non-permanent resident refers to a person from another country with a usual place of residence in Canada and who has a work or study permit or who has claimed refugee status (asylum claimant). Family members living with work or study permit holders are also included unless these family members are already Canadian citizens, landed immigrants (permanent residents), or non-permanent residents themselves."
14,"The net non-permanent residents is final up to 2020/2021, updated for 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
15,"This is an estimate of the number of non-permanent residents in Canada, and differs from the number of asylum claimants and temporary residents from the Department of Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Care should be taken to consider the differences in methods and reference dates when comparing data from IRCC with Statistics Canada demographic estimates. The two data sources are not fully comparable."
16,"The number of people entering Canada to work, study or claim asylum status along with their family members who are not Canadian citizens or landed immigrants (permanent residents)."
17,"The number of work and study permit holders leaving Canada, along with their family members who are not Canadian citizens or landed immigrants (permanent residents). This also includes permit holders and asylum claimants staying in Canada who have been granted permanent resident status. In this case, these persons will be added to the immigration component. Asylum claimants who have had their status revoked will be counted as an outflow."
18,"The net interprovincial migration is final up to 2021/2022 and preliminary for 2022/2023."
19,"Residual deviation is obtained by linearly distributing the opposite value of the error of closure throughout the intercensal period. The error of closure is defined as the difference between the postcensal population estimate on Census Day and the population enumerated in that census adjusted for census net undercoverage and incompletely enumerated reserves and settlements. A positive residual deviation means that the postcensal population estimate on Census Day is less than the adjusted population enumerated in that census. A negative residual deviation means that the postcensal population estimate on Census Day is greater than the adjusted population enumerated in that census."
